# README

The following data files should be in the working directory (or sub-directory as indicated):
- train/X_train.txt
- train/y_train.txt
- train/subject_train.txt
- test/X_test.txt
- test/y_test.txt
- test/subject_test.txt
- activity_labels.txt

Also, an empty file named, "clean.txt", should be in the working directory to receive the cleaned data set.

With all of the above files in the working directory, running the file "run_analysis.R" will output a tidy data set to "clean.txt".
